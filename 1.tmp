+ Explain the concept of Expected Value. (Use some mathematical goodness). 
+ Expected value is the probability-weighted average of all possible values, e.g. in a 6-sided die, the expected value is (1+2+3+4+5+6)/6 = 3.5 cause all sides have similar probability, hence expected value is the average value of a random variable over many experiments.  
+ If the probability of each item varies like the following example (number of workouts per week):
+Number of Workouts (X)
+Probability
+0
+0.1
+1
+0.15
+2
+0.4
+3
+0.25
+4
+0.1
+      
+      Expected Value = Value * Probability, 
+      E(x) = ΣX*p(x) = (0.1*0 + 0.15*1 + 0.4*2 + 0.25*3 + 0.1*4)  = 2.1
+      
+ Write down the equations for mean(m), variance(var) and standard deviation(stddev) of a population vs. a sample. 
+ MeanP= 1nx
+ MeanS= 1n-1x
+ VarP= 1nxi-x2
+ VarS= 1n-1xi-x2
+ StdP= 1nxi-x
+ StdS= 1n-1xi-x
+      
+      
+      
+ What is the average for a continues variable. With an example.
+
+For a continues distribution the mean value is equal to the expected value of Probability Distribution Factor:
+       
+      μ=EX= -infinity+infinityxfxdx
+      
+where f(x) is the Probability Distribution Factor
+
+As for variance:
+σ2=EX-μ2= -infinity+infinityx-μ2fxdx

+Session 2 Essay Assignments
+Mohammad Keyhani
+Instructor: Behrang Koushavand
+Write an Essay to explain the concept of expected value, with an example.
+When a measure or variable can take on multiple values each time it is observed, recorded or measured, and the occurrence of those values involves randomness with known probabilities, then we know the probability distribution of that variable. Then the expected value of the variable is defined as the weighted average of all the values that the variable can possibly take on, weighted by the probability of each of those values. 
+In the case of a uniform probability distribution where the probability of all values is equal, the weights in the weighted average all become equal and the weighted average becomes equivalent to the regular arithmetic mean of the values. Even when the probability of each value is not equal, the expected value and the arithmetic mean have a close relationship: with large enough number of observations, the simple arithmetic mean of all observations converges to the expected value of the probability distribution.
+The larger the variance of a probability distribution, the more any single observation can deviate from the expected value. Thus when variance is larger, more observations are required for the realized expected value of the observations (sample) to approach the actual expected value of the population calculated from the probability distribution.
+For example, the height of people in a population usually has a normal (Guassian) or bell curve probability distribution, where most people are around average height, and the more extreme short heights and extreme long heights are rare.
+For example between a population of 7 adults you may observe the following heights:
+170 cm: 3 men
+150 cm: 2 men
+190 cm: 2 men
+195 cm: 1 man
+145 cm: 1 man
+For this population, the probability of each height value occurring, is the proportion of the people with that height value (the number of people with that height value divided by the total number of people, 9). So the expected value is:
+170*(3/9)+150*(2/9)+190*(2/9)+195*(1/9)+145*(1/9)= 170
+You can see in this case that the expected value is equal to the arithmetic mean of the population as well. The mean is calculated as:
+170*(1/9)+170*(1/9) +170*(1/9)+150*(1/9)+150*(1/9)+190*(1/9)+190*(1/9)+195*(1/9)+145*(1/9)=170
+Write down the equation for mean, variance, and standard deviation.
+
+If each observation i of a population of n is denoted by xi then the equation for arithmetic mean x is as follows:
+x=1n(i=1nxi)
+The equation for variance of a population is:
+Varx= s2=1ni=1n(xi-x)2
+Note: if we are calculating sample variance instead of population variance, we use n-1 as the demoninator rather than n due to Bessel's correction in order to get an unbiased estimator of the population variance.
+The equation for standard deviation of a population is the square root of the variance:
+s= Var(x)=1ni=1n(xi-x)2
+Which again, with Bessel's correction, would be:
+s=1n-1i=1n(xi-x)2
+
+What is the difference between a sample and a population?
+A population is the entire set of possible observations of a random variable. Usually not all possible observations are observed or measured and only a sub-population of them are actually observed. We call this sub-population a sample when we want to estimate the parameters of the population using only information from the sample. We usually try to collect the sample observations through a fully random process, so that they are as representative of the broader population as possible. 
+What is the average of a continuous variable for a population?
+The mean of a continuous random variable x for a population can be calculated if we know the probability density function fx for the population over all possible values of the random variable of interest. Since the variable is continuous, instead of summing like with discrete variables, we need to integrate. The formula for the mean is as follows:
+x=-infinityinfinityxf(x)dx
